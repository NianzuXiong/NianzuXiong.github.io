Hi! I am currently studying DPhil in Economics at the University of Oxford. I am interested in microeconomic theory and corportate finance. I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2023 with MPhil in Economic Research. Before that, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2022 with *summa cum laude* and *Phi Beta Kappa*, where I double majored in mathematics and economics and received distinction in both majors by writing two honors theses simultaneously in my third year of college. I was awarded the Bernard Shanbaum Prize for Excellence in Economics (best Penn undergrad economics major).
