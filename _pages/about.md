Hi! I am currently studying MPhil in Economic Research at the University of Cambridge. My research interest is microeconomic theory. In particular, my previous research focused on analyzing fraud in economic mechanisms and ways to deter it. I graduated from University of Pennsylvania in 2022 with *summa cum laude* and *Phi Beta Kappa*. I double majored in mathematics and economics and received distinction in both majors by writing two honors theses simultaneously in my third year of college. I was awarded the Bernard Shanbaum Prize for Excellence in Economics (best Penn undergrad economics major).
