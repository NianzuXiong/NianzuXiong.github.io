I think about game theory. I am particularly interested in analyzing fraud in economic mechanisms and ways to deter it. I graduated from University of Pennsylvania in 2022 with *Summa Cum Laude* and Phi Beta Kappa. I double majored in Mathematics and Economics and received distinction in both majors by writing two honors theses simultaneously in my third year of college. I was awarded the Bernard Shanbaum Prize for Excellence in Economics (best Penn undergrad economics major). I will pursue an M.Phil. in Economic Research at University of Cambridge next year.
